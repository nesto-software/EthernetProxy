The hardware variant runs without any known issues.   
We are currently not actively developing the software variant.
Thus, special hardware which leverages port mirroring is a prerequisite.

Conceptually, the software variant could be implemented using ip forwarding in the Linux kernel, setting up some iptables rules and capturing the packets using this codebase.
